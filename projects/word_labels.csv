that

","
are
the
main

have
arrived
in

","
Cambodia
","
to
invite
Prince

Min-
ister
","
to
return

No
details

mission
have
been
disclosed
","
but
it
was
reported
earlier
in
Laos
that
Prince
Boun
Oum
was
considering
asking
Government
.
Prince
Souvanna
Phouma
has
not
yet
replied
to
the
mission
","
but
recent
statements
made
by
him
in
Phnom
Penh
indicate
that
he
still
regards
himself
as
the
only
legal
Prime
Minister
of
Laos
.
His
policy
of
strict
neutrality
from
1951
to
1958
kept
the
kingdom
in
peace
","
though
at
the
cost
of
virtual
partition
of
the
country
into
the
pro-communist
north
and
the
pro-western
centre
and
south
.
Prince
Souvanna's
former
Minister
of
Laos
","
yesterday
addressed
all
officers
occupying
the
province
of
Xieng
This
emphasis
on
the
legality
of
the
former
Government
suggests
that
all
is
not
well
with
the
political
and
military
leadership
of
the
pro-communists
.
Most
of
the
province
of
Xieng
Khouang
and
the
tactically
useful
Plain
of
Jars
","
however

appear
still
to
be
firmly
in

hands

Government
has
claimed
the
recapture
of

pro-
communists'
former
base
60

north
of
Vientiane

was
told
by
officers
that
With

Minister
sunning

Jamaica
and

his
Cabinet

the
grass
roots
making
160
speeches
in
80
constituencies
in
10
days
","
the
Liberal
Party
are
holding
a
national
conference
here
with
some
"2,000"
delegates
","
the
biggest
gathering
since
1958
when
Mr.
Lester
Pearson
was
chosen
as
party
leader
.
In
some
ways
it
will
be
a
testing
occasion
unassailable
simply
because
there
is
no
one
else
in
sight
to
supplant
him
.
So
the
con-
ference
will
concentrate
on
laying
the
foundations
on
which
to
win
the
next
election
.
The
rally
comes
at
a
time
when
in
spite
of
carefully
worded
state-
ments
by
the
Prime
Minister
there
is
an
air
of
electoral
expectancy
.
Members
of
the
Cabinet
are
basing
their
speeches
on
a
new
Conservative
booklet
called
The
Record
Speaks
which
outlines
in
some
detail
the
accomplishments
of
the
party
since
it
came
to
office
three
and
a
half
years
ago
.
Nevertheless
there
is
little
illusion
in
the
Conservative
Party
that
their
stock
at
home
has
fallen
in
the
face
of
heavy
unemployment
and
an
uncertain
economy
.
Last
year
saw
the
defeat
of
two
Conservative
provincial
governments
","
Quebec
and
New
Brunswick
","
and
in
the
four
federal
by-elections
last
October
the
party
fared
badly
.
They
are
now
faced
with
four
other
by-
elections
","
one
at
Esquimalt
Saanich
","
British
Columbia
","
one
in
Leeds
","
Ontario
","
and
the
other
two
in
the
Maritimes
-
Restigouche
Madawaska
","
New
Brunswick
","
and
Kings
","
Prince
Edward
Island
.
All
four
were
Conservative
strongholds
.
Last
September
a
public
poll
showed
that
for
the
first
time
since
the
Administration
came
to
power
in
1957
the
Liberals
were
ahead

However
","
a
separate
poll
revealed
that
Mr.
Diefenbaker
was
still
ahead
in
terms
of
popularity
as
an
individual
leader
(
for
Mr.
Diefenbaker
36
per
cent
","
for
Mr.
Pearson
34
per

)
.
How
far
is
Mr.
Lester
Pearson
acceptable
to
the
people
of
Canada
as
a
Prime
Minister
?
Many
observers
at
the
national
rally
will
be
seeking
an
answer
.
It
is
difficult
for
many
to
see
Mr.
Pearson
in

role
of
a
popular
orator
at
the
hustings
","
the
spellbinder
that
Mr.
Diefen-
baker
was
in
the
last
two
campaigns

impression
remains
that

is
still

Soviet

has
them
.
Addressing
the
annual
congress
of
the
National
Union
of
General
and
Municipal
Workers
","
he
said
he
felt
sure
the
Labour
movement
was
coming
round
in
support
of
his
views
.
Obviously
conscious
of
the
fierce
and
widespread
resentment
over
the
U.S.
Polaris
base
in
Britain
","
Mr.
Gaitskell
said
that
he
even
noticed
that
supporters
of
unilateral
nuclear
disarmament
were
changing
their
tactics
by
switching
most
of
their
emphasis
on
to
the
missile
.
Mr
Gaitskell
said
that
a
member
of
an
alliance
could
not
deny
facilities
to
nations
to
which
it
was
allied
.
But
governments
should
be
free
to
negotiate
and
refuse
proposals
with
which
they
did
not
agree
.
The
Labour
Party
opposed
Thor
missiles
","
because
","
he
said
","
they
were
out
of
date
and
vulnerable
and
would
attract
enemy
action
.
That
argument
did
not
apply
to
the
Polaris
submarine
.
So
long
as
the
Soviet
Union
had
nuclear
weapons
","
the
West
","
somewhere
","
must
have
them
too
.
It
was
far
better
for
a
weapon
used
for
retaliatory
purposes
to
be
under
the
sea
rather
than
on
land
.
This
was
why
the
Labour
Party
did
not
think
it
right
to
oppose
the
Polaris
depot
ship
.
The
party
agreed
that
it
was
unwise
to
locate
the
base
in
the
Holy
Loch
","
only
30
miles
from
Glasgow
","
a
city
with
two
million
people
.
It
should
be
sited
in
a
more
remote
area
.
Mr.
Gaitskell
added
that
the
Scarborough
conference
decisions
did
not
","
in
his
view
","
truly
reflect
the
opinions
of
the
majority
supporters
in
the
country
.
Mr
Gaitskell
added
that
agreement
with
the
unilateralists
was
not
possible
","
though
he
respected
their
views
.
He
saw
by
reports
recommending
the
supporters
of
unilateral
nuclear
disarmament
to
shift
the
emphasis
of
their
intervention
away
from
straight
opposition
to
the
Polaris
base
.
To
Mr.
Macmillan
","
Mr
Gaitskell
said
the
Prime
Minister
should
begin
to
take
seriously
the
danger
of
the
spread
of
nuclear
Union
would
be
prepared
to
reach
an
agreement
on
a
zone
of
controlled
disarmament
in
Europe
.
Mr
Gaitskell
concluded
","
declaring
that
the
present
was
the
beginning
of
a
great
period
of
opportunity
for
the
party
.
It
was
a
great
chance
that
should
be
grasped
.
Inter-union
jealousies
prevent
the
fulfilment
of
a
common
policy
for
wages
and
other
major
questions
","
Mr.
Jack
Cooper
The
General
Council
of
the
Trades
Union
Congress
should
therefore
consider
the
matter
.
Consideration
should
also
be
given
to
the
regrouping
of
unions
and
the
modification
of
their
structures
to
meet
the
growing
concentration
of
capital
.
Mr.
Cooper

require

There

to
have

from

out

Mr.

has
had
the
utmost
support
from

C.I.G.S.
","
Field-Marshal
Sir
Francis
Festing
","
who
believes

principle

Gen.
Sir
Richard
Hull
","
who
is
to
succeed
Sir
Francis
","
is
equally
convinced
Mr.
Watkinson
is
right
.
Sir
Francis
is
to
hand
over
to
Sir
Richard
as
from
Nov.
1
.
The
hand-over
","
due
in
September
","
was
delayed
because
of
the
Berlin
crisis
.
Mr.
Watkinson
and
his
advisers
felt
the
change
would
be
unwise
at
a
moment

when
attention
had
to
be
concentrated
on
possible
need
for
important
military
operations
.
For
this
reason
Sir
Francis
stayed
on
","
and

sacrificed
his
leave
.
towards
the
Nationalist
party
of
Dr.
Verwoerd
","

Long
before

at

p.m.
it
was
evident
that
voters
were
bored
by
the
Government's
frequent
appeals
to

electorate
.
The
election
was
the
fourth
in
four
years
.
In
most
constituencies
it
may
go
down
as
the
most
apathetic
in
the
country's
history
.
THE
Prime
Minister
disclosed
in
the
Commons
last
night
that
he
had
considered
early
in
the
Parliamentary
recess
whether
to
mobilise
reserves
necessary
to
bring
the
British
Army
of
the
Rhine
on
to
a
war
footing
.
He
decided
that
it
would
be
a
great
error
there
would
be
no
hesitation
in
mobilising
if
a
further
deterioration
in
the
situation
warranted
such
a
step
.
It
would
have
to
be
accompanied
by
other
measures
of
a
military
","
economic
and
political
kind
.
Mr.

Government's
policy

Conference

Will
it
end
with
South
Africa's
exclusion
from

Commonwealth
?
The
issue
is
touch
and
go

There
is
a
possibility
that
it
will
not
be
settled
at

It
may
be

wait

But
if
a
final
decision
is
to
be
faced
now
","
on
which
side
do
the
strongest
arguments
lie
?
THE
Archbishop
of
Capetown
has
shown
that
the
matter
is
not
clear-cut
.
The
Archbishop
has
long
been
a
courageous
fighter
against
apartheid
.
He
must
be
heard
with
attention
.
On
purely
practical
grounds
he
holds
that
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
expel
South
Africa
","
weakening
the
whites
who
are
working
for
a
change
of
policy
.
In
his
view
it
would
also
be
against
the
interests
of
the
Africans
.
He
holds
that
more
pressure
can
be
put
on
South
Africa
while
she
remains
in
the
Commonwealth
than
could
be
exercised
were
she
cut
off
from
it
.
On
the
other
hand
","
those
who
favour
expulsion
","
inclu-
ding
African
leaders
","
feel
that
nothing
less
than
the
shock
of
expulsion
will
weaken
the
grip
of
Dr.
the
apartheid
policy
.
THE
Commonwealth
is
a
multi-racial
society
.
A
policy
of
racial
discrimination
in
any
of
its
countries
Whatever
statesmen
say
at
the
conference
table
in
London
","
millions
at
home
would
regard
as
fraudulent
a
Commonwealth
which
had
room
for
a
racist
South
Africa
.
And
this
is
a
Commonwealth
in
which
five
citizens
are
coloured
for
every
one
who
is
white
.
Seen
in
this
wider
picture
","
a
South
Africa
that
clings
to
apartheid
is
a
menace
to
the
Commonwealth
and
a
liability
to
the
whole
Western
world
.
A
practical
solution
would
be
for
the
Commonwealth
to
draft
a
set
of
principles
excluding
race
discrimination
.
And
so
leave
South
Africa
to
make
the
grade
","
or
go
out

The

reaction

Sudanese
Government
was
to
denounce
the
United
to
say
that
its
400
troops
in
the
Congo
would
be
taken
home
.
The
reaction
can
be
understood
.
The
Sudan's
concern
for
its
men
is
natural
.
But
this
could
hardly
be
a

dignified
exit

IF
the

for
being

it
would
be

It
is
unjust
to
pass
the
buck
to
Mr.
Hammarskjold
and
the
UN's
servants

The
responsibility
rightly
belongs
to
the
nations
which
have
undertaken
the
task
of
pre-
serving
peace
in
the
Congo

That
is
not
a
ceremonial
duty

and
the
soldiers
have
every
right
to
blame
the
politicians
unless
they
see
it
through

When
the
United
Nations
instructed
Mr.
Hammarskjold
to
use
force
if
necessary
to
prevent
civil
war

it
was
clear
that
new
dangers
would
arise

THE
UN's
ability
to
keep
peace
depends
simply
on
adequate
support
by
the
nations
which
have
set
their
hands
to
this
plough

The
big
Powers

a
millstone
weighing
down

paralysing

work
out

ways

take

consequences

the
truism

menace

mutual
disarmament

be
followed

What
the

has
done

HOW
the
Government
must
repent
its
haste
and
folly
in
Rhodesia
!
Eighteen
months
ago
this
territory
was
peaceful
","
orderly
","
and
thriving
.
Africans
within
the
Federal
Government
were
getting
valuable
experience
in
administration
.
Then
Mr.
Iain
Macleod
became
Colonial
Secretary
.
Suddenly
everything
changed
.
Timetables
were
scrapped
.
The
ill-conceived
Monckton
Commission
was
rushed
out
to
Rhodesia
.
Overnight
","
minor
African
politicians
were
inflated
into
international
figures
.
And
as
the
British
Government
stepped
up
the
pace
of
change
","
so
the
Africans
stepped
up
their
demands
.
TODAY
","
in
London
","
that
rash
and
thoughtless
policy
has
caused
a
crisis
-
a
crisis
that
never
should
have
happened
.
No
wonder
there
is
doubt
and
fearful
heart-searching
.
If
the
Government
now
reverses
its
plan
to
give
the
Africans
control
in
Northern
Rhodesia
it
may
indeed
face
difficulties
from
African
politicians
greedy
for
power
.
But
if
it
fails
to
modify
that
plan
Rhodesia
may
well
be
plunged
into
chaos
","
like
the
Congo
.
For
Mr.
Macmillan
and
his
ministers
there
is
no
choice
.
They
must
safeguard
Rhodesia
against
chaos
.
And
try
to
repair
the
damage
they
have
done
.
WHO
can
grow
the
fastest
?
That
is
the
exciting
competition
going
on
among
Britain's
major
industries
.
Top
of
the
table
","
at
the
moment
","
is
the
chemical
industry
.
Then
comes
engineering
","
followed
by
iron
and
steel
.
Even
the
staid
and
timid
Treasury
is
cheered
by
the
tremendous
upsurge
in
investment
.
It
reports
that
new
factory
building
this
year
is
likely
to
be
40
per
cent
up
on
1960

Britain's

men

cash

After

Throughout

his

pursue

may
ask
:
Is
Welensky

who
disagree

The

answer
that

CONTRAST

what
has

All
this
has
been
achieved
through
Nato
under
American
leadership
.
But
a
big
role
has
been
played
not
only
by
the
British
Government
but
by
Right-Wing
Labour
in
this
country
.
They
have
helped
build
up
Nato
and
rearm
Western
Germany
","
in
pursuit
of
the
old
familiar
anti-Soviet
policy
which
brought
disaster
in
1939
.
Now
the
argument
is
being
used
that
Nato
must
be
maintained
and
Britain
must
stay
in
it
to
keep
the
Germans
in
control
.
Nato
","
far
from
being
a
means
of
controlling
the
German
militarists
","
is
","
in
fact
","
the
cover
for
building
up
their
power
.
What
must
Britain
do
?
Today
","
again
","
she
has
a
key
role
.
Let
her
tell
men
like
Strauss
his
quest
for
atomic
arms
.
A
policy
which
breaks
with
military
alliances
like
Nato
and
seeks
friendship
with
the
Soviet
Union
can
prevent
another
betrayal
like
that
of
the
'30s

I
am
appalled
at
the
character

For
many
years
my

had
to
present
its
views

the
two
major
conferences

take
a

Alongside

we
conducted
our
fight
by
putting
down

unambiguous
alternatives
to
official
policy
and
seeking
to
win
majorities
When
Scarborough
carried
our
point
of
view
we
were
naturally
delighted
","
more
so
because
the
alternatives
had
been
put
clearly
to

movement

which
had
then
chosen
a
vigorous
anti-Nato
","
anti-Tory
","
anti-bomb
and
anti-German

policy
.
Hopes
rose
as
we
saw
a
perspective
of
sharp
struggle
based
on
consistent
lines
of
difference
with
the
Tories

Many
members
understood
that
the
bread-and-butter
struggles

done

trick

And

how

and

a
whole
new
proof
that
to
abandon
Scarborough
is
to
expose
Britain
and
her
working
class
to
sharp
new
dangers
-
that
Gaitskellism
is
bankrupt
.
Ordinary
working
people
will
never
rally
to
defend
a
policy
founded
on
political
chicanery
or
elect
a
Labour
Government
to
carry

Tory
policy
-
that
enormous
inroads
could
already
have
been
made
into
Tory
strength
by
a

At
the

time
that

or
by

confusion

Unity
will
never
be
established
on
the
basis
of
leaders
being
a
law
unto
themselves
and
opposing
conference
decisions
when
it
suits
their
own
convenience
.
Unity
can
never
be
established
by
any
formula
uniting
those
who
oppose
German
troops
being
trained
on
British
soil
and
Polaris
","
and
those
who
are
for
this
policy
-
which
is
the
same
as
that
of
the
Tory
Government
.
It
is
impossible
for
Labour's
new
Defence
state-
ment
to
unite
the
movement
as
the
Labour
leaders
are
not
only
in
favour
of
American
bases

now
supports
the
policy
of
depending
on
American

weapons
and

","
placing
Britain
in
an
even
more
dangerous
position
.
The
statement
of
Padley

Crossman
is
no
different
in
principle
to
the
new
defence
statement

They
accept
American
nuclear
bases
","
and
also
the
use
of
nuclear
weapons
and
nuclear
strategy
until
some
future
date
.
They
deceive
the
people
by
their
talk
of
political
and
collective
control
of
Nato
.
The
Pentagon
has
made
it
perfectly
clear
who
controls
the
American
H-bomb
","
and
There
is
only
one
way
to
develop
unity
and
at
the
same
time
defend
Britain
.
This
was
shown
at
the
Scottish
Trades
Union
Congress
","
representing
"800,000"
organised
trade
unionists
","
when
it
decided
by
overwhelming
votes
","
to
reaffirm
the
Scarborough
decisions
on
unilateral
disarmament
","
and
to
oppose
Polaris
and
military
bases
being
installed
on
the
Holy
Loch
","
or
any
other
part
of
Britain
.
Such
a
policy
would
unite
the
whole
movement
and
lay
the
basis
for
the
defeat
of
the
present
Tory
Government
","
which
has
become
a
real
menace
to
the
British
people
both
in
home
and
foreign
policy
.
It
is
quite
evident
that
the
movement
will
go
on
record
against
the
Polaris
base
and
facilities
for
German
bases
This
should
strengthen
the
campaign
to
end
the
manufacture
and
use
of
nuclear
weapons
in
Britain
.
Britain
then
could
play
a
leading
and
independent
role
for
an
international
agreement
to
ban
all
nuclear
strategy
and
weapons
of
mass
destruction
","
and
lay
the
basis
for
real
peace
and
progress

he
lives

nice

best
moments

known
even
to
Abraham
and
Lot
.
The
new
century
opened
with
James
1
ascending
the
throne
.
He
was
quite
prepared
to
be
tolerant
towards
Rome
though
the
Gunpowder
Plot
spoiled
that
.
The
Puritans
had
high
hopes
","
for
James
had
grown
up
in
Presbyterian
Scotland
","
but
those
hopes
were
dashed
.
True
","
a
new
Prayer
Book
was
issued
in
1604
but
the
Puritans
derived
little
comfort
from
it
.
They
objected
to
the
word
Confirmation
.
So
the
phrase
'
or
the
laying
on
of
hands
upon
children
baptized
and
added
to
the
Catechism
.
This
indicated
how
ephemeral
in
the
Church
had
been
the
mood
which
produced
the
Black
Rubric
","
for
it
says
that
'
the
Body
and
Blood
of
Christ
","
which
are
definite
.
It
was
at
this
time
","
too
","
that
King
James
made
a
Bible
translation
-
the
Authorized
Version
In
that
year
Shakespeare
had
just
turned
forty
and
had
written
Hamlet
two
years
before
.
Bacon
was
at
work
and
Milton
was
just
learning
to
read
.
James
was
followed
by
Charles
","
in
whose
reign
came
the
Scottish
Prayer
Book
in
1637
.
Significantly
this
made
a
deliberate
return
to
the
Book
of
1549
and
became
the
foster
mother
of
some
of
the
most
important
Prayer
Books
in
the
Anglican
Communion
.
Forever
associated
with
Charles
is
Archbishop
Laud
","
now
so
much
nobler
a
figure
than
former
historians
led
us
to
believe
.
Laud
was
enthusiastically
hated
by
Calvinists
and
Puritans
","
and
the
sentiment
was
mutual
.
But
Laud
was
no
Romanizer
.
One
of
his
first
public
acts
was
a
hard-hitting
battle
with
the
Jesuit
","
Fisher
.
But
anyone
who
was
friendly
with
James
and
Charles
","
the
Puritans
argued
","
was
necessarily
a
menace
.
Laud
made
a
positive
approach
.
He
set
out
to
increase
a
sense
of
reverence
.
The
Prayer
Book
was
to
be
respected
and
so
was
the
office
of
a
bishop
.
Altars
should
be
altars
and
not
any
broken
down
","
transportable
table
which
was
handy
for
the
most
improbable
uses
.
In
the
first
place
it
is
not
a
great
deal
of
use
telling
even
children
","
as
I
have
already
suggested
","
not
to
be
silly
or
to
pull
themselves
together
.
Far
better
to
help
them
to
face
whatever
it
is
that
is
worrying
them
","
to
find
the
original
cause
and
then
deal
with
it
;
show
it
up
either
for
the
sham
it
is
-
and
many
fears
are
based
upon
completely
irrational
pre-conceived
notions
-
or
to
Even
worse
is
to
laugh
.
Tremendous
damage
may
be
done
to
a
child
by
laughing
at
what
are
very
real
fears
.
As
adults
","
we
know
that
their
fears
are
groundless
","
indeed
to
us
they
appear
laughable
","
but
to
a
child
they
are
very
real
.
Not
that
I
am
suggesting
that
children
should
be
molly-coddled
-
they
must
be
made
to
face
their
fears
","
to
see
through
them
and
come
out
on
the
other
side
as
victors
.
To
ridicule
them
only
pushes
them
farther
into
themselves
","
so
that
they
become
unable
to
speak
about
it
to
anybody
and
the
seeds
of
any
amount
of
trouble
are
sown
","
the
harvest
of
which
may
still
be
being
reaped
at
forty
or
fifty
.
Far
better
to
agree
with
a
child
that
a
particular
situation
is
frightening
","
and
then
to
face
it
together
until
the
child
can
see
how
unnecessary
its
fears
were
.
Because
situations
which
may
contain
all
the
elements
of
fear
can
arise
suddenly
","
it
is
a
good
idea
to
condition
a
child
to
some
extent
against
it
.
To
keep
a
child
of
twelve
or
thirteen
under
the
impression
that
nothing
nasty
ever
happens
is
not
merely
dishonest
","
it
is
unwise
.
As
I
shall
suggest
in
a
later
chapter
there
are
some
situations
which
occur
less
frequently
than
A
little
more
honesty
","
even
if
one
refrains
from
going
into
too
many
details
","
would
help
many
a
child
to
make
a
proper
adjustment
to
life
as
it
grows
up
.
Let
us
look
at
Jesus
.
We
do
not
","
I
think
","
see
there
a
life
without
fear
.
There
are
several
instances
where
he
seemed
unable
to
go
on
.
In
Gethsemane
He
prayed
that
the
cup
should
pass
from
Him
.
Jesus
shows
us
the
way
to
face
life
.
To
see
all
the
latent
frightening
possibilities
and
yet
by
facing
them
and
knowing
God
is
with
us
and
that
","
with
Him
","
there
is
nothing
that
can
finally
defeat
us
.
More
than
that
","
that
God
has
something
important
to
do
with
our
lives
and
that
the
nearer
we
get
to
Him
","
the
stronger
we
become
.

this

That
a
secret

MOST
people
would
probably
regard
tiredness
as
a
purely
physical
thing
.
The
cure
for
which
is
sleep
.
This
is
only
partly
true
.
Many
people
wake
up
tired
of
a
morning
and
no
amount
of
rest
seems
to
make
any
difference
.
Sleep
","
to
be
effective
","
must
be
of
that
child-like
quality
which
comes
To
others
","
the
long
hours
of
the
night
bring
only
a
disturbed
tossing
and
turning
which
causes
them
to
wake
feeling
worse
than
when
they
went
to
bed
.
We
may
begin
to
understand
this
a
little
better
when
we
realize
that
tiredness
itself
is
largely
in
the
mind
.
Very
few
people
","
under
normal
conditions
","
work
themselves
to
a
standstill
.
The
mind
tires
first
and
conveys
the
impression
of
tiredness
to
the
body
.
This
can
be
proved
by
noting
the
effect
of
a
new
stimulus
on
some-
body
who
feels
thoroughly
tired
.
Suppose
a
mother
has
news
late
at
night
that
her
child
is
in
danger
.
She
will
undertake
a
journey
which
","
an
hour
before
","
she
would
have
declared
impossible
.
Even
more
simply
","
test
your
own
reactions
to
different
situations
.
There
are
some
which
bring
on
an
almost
immediate
feeling
of
tiredness
-
such
as
when
your
wife
mentions
refer
to
something
you
like
doing
","
bring
a
veritable
surge
of
energy
.
Many
a
girl
who
up
with
no
apparent
tiredness
at
all
when
her
boy
friend
calls
and
go
for
a
long
walk
.
Nor
is
she
necessarily
being
deceitful
.
She
really
did
feel
tired
until
the
mind
got
the
necessary
injection
of
a
fresh
-
and
an
attractive
-
interest
!
Tiredness
has
","
therefore
","
as
much
to
do
with
our
mental
state
as
with
our
physical
exhaustion
.
A
disturbed
mind
can
bring
the
healthiest
body
to
a
sense
of
fatigue
.
They
wonder
why
they
get
no
rest
at
night
","
even
if
they
do
sleep
.
a
burden
to
their
families
and
their
friends
.
Any
mental
confusion
can
cause
this
and
the
best
way
is
probably
to
seek
advice
.
As
we
are
unable
to
cure
our
own
bodies
if
the
cause
of
our
pain
is
too
deep
seated
","
so
we
are
unable
to
cure
our
own
minds
","
involving
careful
and
patient
treatment
.
One
of
the
greatest
steps
forward
that
has
been
made
this
century
is
the
way
in
which
illness
of
the
mind
is
no
longer
feared
or
shunned
","
and
is
in
fact
no
differently
regarded
than
physical
illness
.
There
is
","
nevertheless
","
a
great
deal
of
tiredness
which
comes
from
no
major
complication
but
results
from
an
inability
to
deal
with
life
","
especially
under
the
diverse
pattern
which
is
the
twentieth
century
.
In
the
days
when
most
people
were
born
","
lived
and
died
within
the
boundaries
of
the
village
","
it
was
not
difficult
for
anybody
to
live
a
day
at
a
time
.
Even
those
who
held
a
high
and
responsible
office
lived
in
far
greater
simplicity
than
their
successors
.
When
news
from
the
Continent
took
days
","
from
America
weeks
","
from
the
Far
East
","
months
","
even
a
Prime
Minister
could
go
to
sleep
in
blissful
ignorance
of
what
might

become
so
complex
that
it
taxes

mind

Two
hundred
piece
.
Now
a
man
may
live
twenty
","
thirty
even
sixty
miles
from
his
work
.
The
only
connexion
is
the
pipeline
of
the
railway
on
which
they
travel
day
by
day
.
their
place
of
work
and
their
associates
at
are
possibly
like
in
the
surroundings
of
their
homes
.
It
is
easy
","
desperately
easy
","
to
lead
a
'
double
'
life
without
ever
deliberately
planning
to
do
so
or
in
fact
being
conscious
of
what
is
going
on
.
It
is
easier
to
live
life
in
compartments
but
over
the
years
it
builds
up
","
and
to
do
so
inevitably
builds
up
tensions
which
Can
we
then
frame
some
'
rules
'
which
may
enable
us

live
life

fully
as
possible

our
energy
sapped

We
have
a
saying
'
My
head
will
never
save
my
feet
'
.
Time
after
time
we
forget
something
and
have
to
go
back
upstairs
or
down
to
the
shops
.
If
we
ever
stopped
to
consider
how
much
energy
-
and
time
-
we
lose
this
way
in
the
course
of
a
day
we
would
be
become
too
pernickety
.
Nevertheless
","
we
could
all
probably
be
a
little
more
orderly
for
we
so
frequently
just
muddle
through
.
The
housewife
would
find
life
far
less
tiring
if
she
made
a
list
","
followed
a
routine
of
work
rather
than
getting
from
one
thing
to
the
next
.
The
business
man
would
find
that
he
reached
the
end
of
the
day
with
far
less
strain
if
he
was
a
little
more
systematic
.
To
drift
aimlessly
along
is
more
wearying
than
any-
thing
else
.
If
we
would
only
sit
down
and
write
out
all
the
necessary
jobs
waiting
to
be
done
and
then
work
quietly
through
them
","
we
would
find
life
considerably
less
exhausting
There
may
be
some
who
will
argue
that
routine
destroys
the
soul
.
It
is
so
easy
","
they
say
","
to
get
into
a
rut
.
Save
us
from
the
school
curriculum
and
even
worse
the
school
system
whereby
for
meals
everybody
knows
beforehand
exactly
what
","
on
any
given
day
of
the
week
","
they
are
going
to
have
.
If
-
such
a
critic
may
say
-
you
are
calling
us
to
adventure
","
do
not
strangle
us
before
I
am
more
than
conscious
of
this
.
How
anybody
can
go
through
the
same
routine
day
in
and
day
out
for
forty
years
I
find
difficult
to
understand
.
A
lot
of
it
is
inevitable
so
that
industry
and
commerce
may
be
kept
going
-
though
if
ever
it
becomes
possible
to
work
out
a
system
of
'
staggered
'
hours
it
may
do
an
immense
amount
of
good
over
and
above
relieving
As
it
is
","
with
so
much
of
our
life
already
in
a
predetermined
groove
","
I
would
hardly
like
to
add
further
to
the
dullness
for
this
.
I
know
how
much
of
a
drag
it
can
be
and
I
was
interested
some
little
while
ago
to
hear
of
a
school
who
tried
a
six-
day
timetable
.
They
only
worked
","
of
course
","
a
five-
day
week
so
that
in
the
first
week
Monday
to
Friday
were
days
one
to
five
of
the
timetable
","
the
following
Monday
was
day
six
and
Tuesday
started
day
one
again
and
so
on
.
By
this
means
they
avoided
each
week
being
the
same
with
a
pupil
knowing
exactly
what
the
subject
would
be
on
Friday
afternoon
at
3
p.m.

It
was

little
complicated

work

in
the
entrance

which
day
of
the
timetable
it
was
-
but
and
kept
everybody
on
their
toes
.
To
have
order
does
not
mean
getting
into
a
dull
routine
.
I
have
great
sympathy
with
the
young
wife
who
does
not
always
want
to
do
I
would
not
want
to
either
","
but
if
she
wants
to
get
through

down
quietly
and
make
a
list
of
everything
she
has
got
to
do

note
the
order
in
which
they
can
most
conveniently
be
done

Mishnah
quotes
two
further
proof
texts

Gemara

a
careful
examination
of

passage

it
clear
that

Finally
","
we
note
that

comment

Rabh

From
the
above
it
follows
that

once
again

we
have
a
good
illustration
of
how
a
sugya
has
been
fashioned
from
material
already

hands
of

Redactors

sugya
is
built
around
the
saying
of

The
proof
text
of
greeting
by
the
divine
Name
is
taken
from
the
Mishnah
.
There
is
no
reference
to
the
Mishnah
here
because
the
Mishnah
deals
with
the
actual
practice
of
greeting
by
the
divine
Name
and
the
Gemara
here
quotes
the
texts
to
support
the
thesis
of
R.
Joshua
b.

The
question
and
answer
with
regard
to
the
need
for
the
text
of
the
angel
are
quoted
here
in
the
same
words
in
which
they
are
quoted
in
the
discussion
on
the
Mishnah

This
can
either
mean
that
both
sugyas
are
answer
or
that
our
sugya
is
quoting
from
the
longer
sugya
which
deals
with
all
four
texts
quoted
in
the
Mishnah

Or
it
is
possible
that
our
sugya
contains
the
original
question
and
answer
and
this
is
quoted
in
the
other
sugya
.

This
can
be
supported
by
the
accord

approval

to
have
been
framed

place
of
this
on
the
saying
of
R.
Joshua
b.
Levi
which
deals
with
a
similar
theme
.
We
know
from
the
diaries
of
Samuel
Pepys
that
he
was
a
great
man
for
lace
-
paying
as
much
as
3
for
a
lace
collar
.
But
this
didn't
mean
he
was
prepared
to
do
as
much
for
his
lady
","
for
he
records
testily
:

and
among
the
effects
left
by
Nell
Gwyn
is
an
unpaid
bill
for
'
scarlet

shoes
with
silver

'
.
The
records
of
these
tender
trifles
are
very
touching
but
then
lace
does
place
upon
everything
a
delicate
sentiment
.
Lucky
indeed
are
the
families
that
possess
a
heritage
of
lace
.
A
lace
bridal
veil
handed
down
from
mother
to
daughters
","
a
lace-trimmed
Christening
robe
that
each
generation
wears
in
turn
-
these
are
proud
possessions
","
linked
to
the
exquisite
lace-making
of
the
past
.
But
lace-making
is
by
no
means
a
lost
art
.
It
suffered
a
decline
and
fell
into
lamentably
low
standards
in
the
fussy
over-furnishing
of
the
Victorian
age
but
it
would
take
more
than
a
temporary
lapse
in
good
taste
to
destroy
this
lovely
","
viable
craft
.
It
has
","
in
fact
","
readily
adapted
itself
to
modern
tastes
and
the
ill-
ustrations
in
the
following
pages
will
show
how
completely
it
is
in
sympathy
with
con-
temporary
surroundings
.
It
will
be
seen
how
","
with
bold
design
and
rich
colour
","
knitting
","
crochet
and
tatting
in
fine
and
medium-weight
cottons
can
give
striking
individuality
to
many
things
in
the
home
.
Chairbacks
","
cushions
","
tablecloths
","
to
mention
only
three
-
how
satisfying
it
is
to
avoid
the
ready-made
in
these
and
by
one's
own
handiwork
produce
something
that
reflects
true
creative
talent
.
The
more
delicate
patterns
and
finer
threads
may
be
reserved
to
bring
a
light
and
lovely
touch
to
personal
possessions
-
a
lace
border
to
a
handkerchief
","
fine-lace
insertion
on
a
petticoat
or
blouse
","
a
tatted
edge
to
a
collar
;
these
add
a
charming
","
feminine
distinction
that
nothing
else
can
give
.
Although
we
assess
lace-making
as
one
of
the
feminine
skills
","
a
number
of
the
well-loved
traditional
patterns
that
we
follow
today
were
","
in
fact
","
the
brain-children
of
inventive
men
.
For
in
the
old
order
of
things
","
men
designed
and
worked
lace
as
well
as
women
and
special
schools
were
set
up
to
teach
lace-
making
not
only
to
young
girls
","
but
to
little
livelihood
by
lace-making
and
consequently
a
folklore
of
song
","
festival
and
courtship
grew
up
around
the
lace
industry
.
During
the
sixteenth
century
a
considerable
amount
of
crochet
was
produced
in
the
convents
of
Europe
.
Without
doubt
it
was
the
nuns
who
carried
the
craft
to
Ireland
.
There
it
was
developed
into
quite
an
elaborate
and
distinctive
form
with
rosettes
","
leaves
and
lace
fillings
.
During
the
time
of
Victoria
this
gentle
craft
was
greatly
abused
.
One
can
remember
with
horror
the
pictures
of
the
overcrowded
and
over-embellished
drawing-rooms
complete
with
heavy
crochet
antimacassars
","
mantel-
piece
covers
with
a
fringing
of
clumsy
bobbles
and
numerous
other
crocheted
pieces
.
It
was
some
years
after
the
Victorian
period
that
designers
realised
the
potentialities
of
the
craft
","
and
crochet
was
revived
with
designs
suitable
for
contemporary
trends
.
Crochet
today
has
a
variety
of
uses
","
and
has
even
stepped
into
the
field
of
high
fashion
.
In
some
of
the
elegant
boutiques
of
Paris
hand-crocheted
blouses
","
gossamer
fine
in
texture
","
are
sold
at
a
very
high
price
.
With
a
little
time
and
concentration
the
woman
at
home
can
produce
fashion
articles
as
elegant
as
those
of
Paris
-
a
blouse
","
delicate
gloves
or
a
fine
edging
for
collar
","
cuffs
or
a
handkerchief
.
In
the
home
","
crochet
lace
can
be
used
to
make
tablecloths
","
traycloths
and
runners
","
and
edgings
from
heavy
to
fine
can
fulfil
a
variety
of
functions
.
The
art
of
crochet
is
not
difficult
and
it
is
reasonably
quick
to
work
.
In
the
following
pages
simple
diagrams
and
instructions
are
given
to
enable
the
beginner
to
master
all
the
essential
crochet
stitches
.
First
launder
crochet
and
then
pin
to
the
required
accurate
.
Place
crochet
in
correct
position
on
linen
and
secure
with
pins
.
Run
a
line
of
basting
stitches
on
the
linen
following
the
outline
of
the
crochet
edges
which
are
to
be
attached
to
the
linen
.
Remove

Two
methods
can
be
used
to

we

their
shortcomings

most
gardeners
have
a
nostalgic
affection
for
them

there

no

so
they
have
the
decided
advantage
of
being
the
only
suitable
container
available
in
quantity
for
fairly
large
plants

Soil

are
probably
the
oldest
alternative
to
clay
pots
for
plant
raising
.

are

big
advantage
of
soil
blocks
is
an
obvious
one
:
the
cost
of
a
pot
of
any
description
is
saved
completely
.
Manufacturing
the
block
and
planting
it
is
very
little
more
trouble
than
normal
potting
","
and
a
superior
plant
","
which
transplants
more
easily
","
is
produced
.
The
obvious
limitation

is
that
soil
blocks
can
only
be
used
for
propagating
;
there
can
be
no
progression
to
a
larger
block
when
the
plant
or
seedling
is
ready
to
be
moved
;
it
must
be
planted
out
or
potted
.
Many
amateur
gardeners
might
improve
their
results
by
buying
a
small
hand-operated
soil
block
maker
and
use
the
money
saved
on
buying
small
pots
to
improve
their
composts

The
various
types
of
small
paper
pots
are
very
useful
for
short-term
operations

but
are
inclined
to
collapse
if
the
plants
are
in
them
too
long
.
They
are

quite
useful

are

there

one

identified
as

this

led
to

abandoned

paid

spent

approach

made

twenty
large
firms

the
first
experimental
day-release
course

organised

Eleven
students

ded
a

full
Fridays

it
was
made
clear
both
to

men

employers

the
venture
was

experiment
from
which
the
organisers
hoped
to
learn
as
much
as

there
differences

occupational
levels
are
the
better

poorer

adjustment

Does
the
evidence
obtained

a
rationale
for
adapting
a
pre-retirement
planning

the
needs

he
didn't
get
in

Instead
he
might
have
ended

way
:
Well
","
those
are
my
views

When
he
learned
what
was
causing
the
commotion
he
became
greatly
alarmed
","
and
after
the
body
had
been
taken
to
St
Thomas's
Hospital
it
was
his
grief-stricken
duty
formally
to
identify
Elizabeth
Camp
","
aged
thirty-three
","
the
girl
who
was
to
have
been
his
bride

There
was
little
doubt
of
how
she
had
met
her
death
","
and
even
less
that
it
had
been
murder
.
She
had
been
struck
several
times
with
a
blunt
instrument

her
head
was
smashed
in

were
signs

struggle

broken
umbrella

But
a
pair
of
bone
cuff-links
found
in
the
compartment
seemed
to
provide
the
only
possible
clue
to
the
killer
.
The
body
was
examined
","
and
it
was
definitely
established
that
no
sexual
assault
had
taken
place
.
It
seemed
probable
that
the
motive
had
been
robbery

and
this
was
further
confirmed

a
check
was
made
with
the
woman's
relations
in
Hounslow

Miss
Camp
had
been
the
housekeeper

public-house

day
off
was

evening

had

lived

Elizabeth
had

late
afternoon

she
had

of

It
is
not

discuss

dictum

Suffice
to
say
that
few
of
us
stop
to
marvel
at
the
progress
of
civilisation
which
allows
a
dish
borrowed
straight
from
the
prehistoric
.
How
many
centuries
ago
","
in
some
cave
or
hilly
hide
","
did
our
forebears
home
from
the
chase
hold
forth
from
a
spear
the
welcome
gobbet
of
meat
or
fish
burnt
and
roasted
in
the
homely
and
protecting
flame
.
How
many
centuries
later
did
the
mercenary
in
the
Roman
wars
thus
impale
on
pike
or
lance
his
evening
meal
.
Later
came
the
thrifty
peasant
","
later
still
the
young
Victorian
buck
adventuring
in
Paris
","
and
even
later
our
attractive
young
ladies
toying
with
these
primitive
morsels
in
the
gleam
and
glitter
of
our
latter-day
restaurants
.
And
","
if
certain
dishes
and
modes
of
food
have
persisted
down
the
ages
","
the
motive
that
preserved
always
been
strong
in
mankind
.
The
sharing
of
a
meal
in
those
earliest
dangerous
days
was
an
admittance
into
an
acquaintanceship
far
more
important
than
the
casual
meetings
of
the
present
day
;
the
desire
to
share
something
more
intimate
than
mere
converse
has
always
been
there
.
The
truth
is
that
good
food
offers
a
programme
of
entertainment
almost
unlimited
in
its
variety
and
its
presen-
tation
affords
an
opportunity
of
showing
a
guest
something
of
ourselves

fight

Gaunt

skill

It

the
advantages
of
a
ring
of
bridge-heads
which
included
Calais

Cherbourg

","
and
that
there
was
no
hope
of

victory
without
a
large-scale
and
concentrated
invasion
.
BUT
NONE
OF
THESE
DEDUCTIONS
WERE
DRAWN
AT
THE
TIME
","
BECAUSE
LARGE-
SCALE
WAR
REQUIRED
MONEY
","
AND
THE
CITIZENS
WHO
HAD
THE
MONEY
WERE
NOT
YET
SUFFICIENTLY
AT

WITH
NOBLES
AND
KING
TO
THINK
THEIR
MONEY
WELL
SPENT
IN
FIN-
ANCING
A
RULING
CLASS
WHICH
DESPISED
THEM
.
THE
COMMONS
WERE
GLAD
ENOUGH
TO
ENJOY
THE
FRUITS
In
this
cruel
process
which
was
hammering
out
nations
on
the
anvils
of
war
","
there
was
a
constant
stirring
of
those
in
authority
to
find
some
simple
way
out
of
the
complicated
financial
6impasse
which
always
resulted
","
and
in
the
story
of
the
experiments
and
expedients
to
which
the
Exchequer
resorted
is
the
story
of
the
prelude
to
the
Peasants'
Revolt
of
1381
.
In
appreciating
this
story
","
modern
con-
ceptions
of
governmental
duties
must
be
set
aside
.
A
modern
government
needs
taxation
not
merely
for
defence
and
offence
but
for
a
very
wide
range
of
social
services
.
A
mediaeval
oligarchy
needed
taxation
in
order
to
supplement
the
private
wealth
of
the
monarchy
crown
lands
","
the
fees
of
feudalism
Social
service
as
a
function
of
government
was
quite
alien
to
mediaeval
thought
-
its
communities
","
whether
those
communities
were
monasteries
","
manors
","
townships
","
or
wards
and
guilds
of
a
city
.
A
mediaeval
tax
was
therefore
in
essence
a
forced
payment
whose
return
was
the
uncertain
bounty
of
booty
and
the
vague
advantages
of
military
glory
;
it
was
therefore
always
granted
grudgingly
and
coupled
with
the
vain
hope
that
","
in
the
When
'
his
'
war
did
not
bring
victory
and
booty
","
a
new
group
of
Lords
might
oust
the
unsuccessful
leaders
","
and
the
Commons
","
who
usually
supplied
the
hard
cash
","
might
be
bold
enough
to
demand
the
production
of
accounts
","
and
even
at
times
the
impeachment
of
the
unsuccessful
.
But
the
Commons
were
not
the
people
","
and
even
a
full
Parliament
was
not
yet
a
true
mirror
of
the
nation
.
The
people
-
Langland's
'
folk
'
and
Gaunt's
'
knaves
'
-
were
villeins
still
tied
to
the
feudal
obligations
of
work
or
villeins
who
had
bought
their
release
","
free
labourers
who
worked
for
the
highest
bidders
","
free
yeomen
who
had
prospered
enough
to
become
successful
farmers
","
the
artisans
","
craftsmen
","
journeymen
and
small
tradesmen
of
the
towns
","
and
the
retainers
and
men-at-arms
in
the
pay
of
landed
Lords
.
None
of
these
classes
","
except
the
yeomen
","
paid
or
expected
to
pay
direct
taxes
.
During
the
four-
teenth
century
","
the
traditional
methods
of
financing
the
Exchequer
had
become
stabilized
.
When
the
King
and
his
Council
required
additio-
nal
funds
","
they
were
usually
granted
an
export
tax
on
the
wool
trade

means

Church
","
which
wisely
followed
the
lead
of
the
Commons
and
in
its
own
Convocations

foreign
merchants

the
King's
officials
had
formerly
made

payments
were
now
authorized
by
parliamentary
sanction
at
a
rate
roughly
fifty
per
cent
in
excess
of
the
rate
for
native
merchants
.
In
addition
to
these
revenues
","
the
King
had
the
financial
benefits
of
his
position
at
the
head
of
the
feudal
system
","
as
its
chief
landowner
and
the
recipient
of
the
fines
of
royal
justice
.
It
was
","
therefore
","
a
complicated
and
not
very
satisfactory
financial
system
in
which
the
borders
between
private
and
public
purse
were
and
national
war
","
and
in
which
the
comparati-
vely
simple
obligations
of
the
feudal
pyramid
But
this
time
there
was
a
very
interesting
attempt
to
apply
a
sliding
scale
to
the
payments
demanded
.
The
definition
of
an
adult
was
altered
to
read
'
over
sixteen
'
","
and
","
where
the
poorest
were
to
pay
a
groat
","
the
Duke
of
Lancaster
and
the
Archbishops
of
Canterbury
and
York
were
to
pay
ten
marks
","
and
between
these
two
extremes
a
graduated
scale
of
payments
was
fixed
for
the
different
classes
of
laymen
and
clerics
.
Again
the
resentment
was
widespread
and
the
results
disappointing
-
a
tax
estimated
to
yield
"50,000"
in
fact
raised
only
"27,000"
.
In
the
following
year
","
1380
","
the
last
and
most
notorious
third
poll-tax
was
agreed
by
a
Parliament
which
met
at
Northampton
.
There
were
dark
reasons
for
a
meeting
so
far
away
from
the
capital
in
a
town
with
poor
communications
and
not
over
supplied
with
hostelries
and
lodgings
.
London
was
again
in
turmoil
;
but
this
time
over
a
question
of
trade
rivalry
.
A
rich
mer-
chant
from
Genoa
had
been
murdered
","
and
John
de
Kyrkby
","
a
Londoner
","
was
one
of
those
charged
with
the
crime
.
It
is
clear
from
the
chronicles
that
this
was
a
sordid
quarrel
between
monopolists
and
interlopers
.
The
city
merchants
were
jealous
of
foreign
merchants
who
could
tempt
court
and
baronage
with
rarer
luxuries
than
those
A
sum
of
"160,000"
was
demanded
-
a
staggering
figure
to
mediaeval
eyes
.
It
was
determined
that
"100,000"
was
a
fairer
target
","
and
the
Parliament
agreed
to
find
two-thirds
of
this
sum
providing
the
clergy
supplied
the
remainder
.
The
method
of
assessment
to
which
the
Commons
agreed
was
that
of
the
first
poll-tax
.
The
manifest
injustice
of
this
method
had
been
to
a
certain
degree
corrected
by
the
sliding
scale
of
the
second
poll-tax
","
but
this
lesson
was
ignored
","
and
the
injustice
trebled
in
weight
by
a
flat-rate
tax
at
treble
the
rate
-
every
adult
Trebling
the
rate
was
arrived
at
by
a
simple
The
only
concession
made
in
view
of
the
objections
to
the
first
two
poll-taxes
was
the
suggestion
that
the
rich
should
help
the
poor
-
but
this
was
only
a
pious
hope
because
no
machinery
was
provided
for
carrying
it
into
effect
","
and
a

the
people
appreciated
the

In
1910
Dr.
Talbot
was
translated
to
Winchester
","
and
Dr.
Hubert
Burge
became
Bishop
of
Southwark
.
Meanwhile
I
had
been
asked
to
do
a
bit
of
Diocesan
work
in
connection
with
Higher
Religious
Education
","
and
to
become
the
Southwark
Secretary
of
the
Church
Reading
Union
.
This
meant
organizing
lectures
and
courses
of
religious
instruction
through
the
Diocese
","
and
I
also
found
myself
a
member
of
the
Diocesan
Conference
","
where
I
remember
introducing
myself
as
the
incumbent
of
the
highest
church
in
the
Diocese
.
There
was
a
somewhat
shocked
atmosphere
in
some
quarters
","
until
I
explained
that
my
church
was
800
feet
high
above
the
sea
level
!
The
work
was
growing
pretty
heavy
","
and
we
managed
to
get
a
stipendiary
layman
who
could
help
among
the
children
and
young
people
.
It
was
while
I
was
at
Tatsfield
that
I
first
visited
Oberammergau
in
Bavaria
to
witness
the
Passion
Play
.
The
place
and
its
people
were
to
play
an
important
part
in
my
life
.
For
five
years
in
succession
till
war
broke
out
in
1914
","
I
spent
my
summer
holidays
there
and
became
very
intimate
with
the
people
and
the
environs
.
Every
year
between
the
Passion
Plays
","
an
interval
of
ten
years
","
another
play
would
be
performed
at
the
small
theatre
in
the
village
","
when
new
talent
would
be
discovered
and
trained
.
After
the
First
World
War
","
1914
","
I
did
not
visit
Germany
for
ten
years
","
by
which
time
in
1924
I
was
in
a
different
parish
in
Surrey
.
Towards
the
end
of
my
five
and
a
half
years'
incumbency
I
was
asked
if
I
would
start
a
village
choral
society
and
conduct
it
.
This
opened
up
a
new
interest
","
and
we
plunged
into
it
.
First
of
all
simple
part-songs
:
I
found
only
one
member
who
had
any
idea
of
reading
music
.
This
was
the
village
doctor
who
was
an
old
school
friend
at
Clifton
.
He
could
sustain
the
tenor
part
quite
well
and
lead
the
others
.
As
for
basses
and
altos
the
conductor
had
to
teach
by
singing
the
parts
with
them
.
It
was
very
amusing
","
and
by
the
end
of
a
few
months
an
enthusiastic
choir
of
men
and
women
could
render
simple
part-singing
tolerably
well
.
Then
we
went
to
work
on
Coleridge
Taylor's
'
Hiawatha's
Wedding
Feast
.
'
Enthusiasm
grew
","
and
in
a
few
more
months
we
gave
a
concert
at
which
the
accompanist
was
the
village
schoolmaster
","
and
the
tenor
solo
'
Onaway
awake
'
was
sung
by
the
Rector
.
and
we
were
all
happy
.
IN
1913
Dr.
Burge
","
Bishop
of
Southwark
","
asked
me
to
go
as
who
was
to
become
a
very
intimate
friend
","
and
I
was
solicitor
cousin
.
As
Bishop
Talbot
had
told
me
that
I
ought
not
to
spend
many
years
in
Tatsfield
","
we
held
great
family
consultations
.
My
eldest
brother
was
then
living
in
Limpsfield
with
his
family
","
and
found
a
very
suitable
house
nearby
where
my
mother
settled
","
and
eventually
died
in
1926
at
the
Institution
and
Induction
Service
in
St.
Mark's
.
This
was
taken
by
the
Suffragan
Bishop
of
Woolwich
","
a
close
friend
of
ours
.
But
what
a
change
from
the
dear
little
old
church
at
Tatsfield
to
the
great
modern
church
of
St.
Mark's
at
Purley
.
One
felt
at
Tatsfield
that
","
small
as
the
had
been
a
House
of
Prayer
.
I
could
not
but
feel
the
chilliness
of
the
new
church
","
beautiful
as
it
was
and
is
.
When
we
had
found
a
group
of
people
who
gladly
co-operated
","
we
made
the
little
side
chapel
a
place
of
daily
prayer
.
I
suggested
to
the
congregation
that
it
needed
warming
up
by
constant
prayer
and
worship
","
and
we
found
many
to
help
.
Gifts
of
candlesticks
and
stained-glass
lancet
windows
-
finally
a
new
altar
-
helped
to
furnish
the
chapel
as
a
little
sanctuary
for
prayer
and
quiet
.
In
time
we
received
similar
windows
.
It
was
very
interesting
to
have
the
privilege
of
filling
such
a
beautiful
building
with
suitable
fittings
;
I
made
the
architect
","
himself
a
fine
artist
.
It
is
quite
possible
to
put
beautiful
things
into
a
beautiful
church
and
yet
spoil
the
building
with
ornaments
unsui-
table
to
the
environs
.
We
also
had
a
little
Mission
Hall
leading
off
the
Brighton
Road
","
in
a
street
full
of
small
houses
.
This
was
called
Ellen
Avenue
when
I
first
went
there
","
but
was
soon
changed
into
the
better-
were
lots
of
children
there
","
and
we
had
a
flourishing
Sunday
School
and
an
evening
more
help
both
at
the
church
and
Mission
district
.
The
Church
Army
Captain
had
done
very
good
work
in
the
Lansdowne
Road
district
","
but
I
needed
more
help
in
the
church
for
the
full
rota
of
services
on
Sundays
and
weekdays
.
1913
soon
after
I
had
come

and
he
organized
the
Mission
district
and
got
to
know

and
be
known
by

many
of
the
people
of
the
parish
.
A
great
blow
disturbed
all
our
efforts
in
the
following

Forces

urgently
needed

and
I
felt
clearly
that
one
of
us
must
volunteer

The
Bishop

Dr.
Burge

did
not
wish
me
to
go

soon

France
where
he
did
splendid
work
until
his
health
broke
down

enteric
fever
.
Meanwhile
in
Purley
there
was
much

met
once
a
week
in

Very
soon
we
managed
to
get
a
hut
in
Purley
where
soldiers
were
very
welcome
and
the
ladies
organized
a
canteen
.
Life
was
in
those
years
more
than
busy
.
We
now
had
a
vicarage
next
to
the
church
","
and
I
was
most
fortunate
in
having
for
eight
years
a
most
able
and
devoted
housekeeper

I
had
known
well
in
Limpsfield

She
was

treasure

of
yeoman
stock

clever
in
all
domestic
things

a
widow

knew
how
to

the
only

as
they
came
into

filled
in

Each
child
had
a
picture
given
them
and
the
lesson
was
largely
based
on
this
.
It
was
on
a
stamp

could
be
stuck
in

there
was
quite
a

Speaking
of
churchwardens
and
children
leads
me
at
once
to
chronicle
a
most
intimate
and
lasting
friendship
begun
in
1913
in
Purley
and
continuing
till
old
age
to-day
.
When
I
went
to
St.
Mark's
","
the
first
contact
I
made
was
sons
was
just
coming
into
the
world
in
this
year
of
1913
.
From
then
till
now
the
acquaintance
ripened
into
a
very
deep
friendship
which
I
have
taken
with
me
through
Mrs.
Charlton

been
from
the
first
difficult
years
of
war

when
most
lives
were
upset

for
since

years

the
welcome
has
never
failed

outset
","
and
when
we
don't
see
one
another
we
do
not
forget
.
In
those
early
years
1914-18
","
life
was
very
full
both
in
the
parish
and
in
the
wider
war
activities
.
The
Bishop
","
knowing
that
I
spent
my
holidays
in
Bavaria
","
asked
me
if
I
would
do
something
for
two
wards
at
the
Royal
Herbert
Hospital
","
full
of
war
prisoners
.
I
was
very
glad
to
help
in
this
way
","
and
visited
them
frequently
","
establishing
at
once
a
friendly
contact
with
the
Bavarian
wounded
who
were
delighted
to
find
someone
who
knew
their
native
villages
.
I
could
at
once
notice
the
great
antagonism
between
the
Bavarians
and
the
Prussians
who
openly
scorned
these
more
simple
country
folk
.
Less
than
no
response
from
the
Russian
side
led
one
to
fear
that
the
event
might
well
have
the
outcome
that
the
Nazis
evidently
hoped
might
the
setting
up
among
the
German
population
of
a
general
system
of

The
Nazi
fortress
concept
turned
out
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
fantasy
.
Thanks
to
the
good
sense
of
the
front
line
soldiers
","
the
meeting
of
East
and
West
was
marked
by
the
use
of
no
weapon
more
lethal
than
vodka
.
And
the
effect
on
the
German
people
of
the
first
ten
years
of
the
promised
thousand
of
Nazi
rule
","
so
far
from
creating
a
spirit
of
warlike
frenzy

produced
universally
a
dull
bewildered
apathy

far

our

led
us

we
had

Quite
apart
from
the
divagations
of
her

'

she
constantly
referred
to
him

there
were
a
hundred
reasons
why
it
would
be
objectionable
to
have
the
family
history
exposed

latitude
she
allowed
in
the
warmth
of
her
kindly
nature

others

believed

was
no

of

lived
down
the
rumours

had
made

a
nightmare

fame
was
","

very
wonderful

but
it
carried
with
it
too
many
reminders
of
his
terrible
indiscretions

the
writing
of
Don
Juan
","
which
she
had
never
ceased
to
deplore
","
his
shocking
blasphemies

the
Vision
of

","
his
making
friends
with
the
atheist
known
to
her
as
'
that
infamous
Mr.
Shelley
'
","
and
his
mixing
with
really
low
and
horrid
people

as
the
subversive
journalist
Leigh

would
never

there
was

with
those
unbearable

Dallas

was
full
of
fight

for
the
injunction
to
be
lifted
.
He
had
gone
to
Byron's
cousin

had
got
him
to
compose
an
affidavit

he
had

things

of
calamities

that
hurt

the
chosen

These

were
precisely
the
reasons
why
her
cousin
took
pleasure
in
the
opportunity
of
annoying
her

Lady
Byron
did
not
like
Augusta
to
have
intimate
friends

and
in
every
instance
where
the
occasion
was
granted
her
","
she
managed

confidences

never

the
truth

that
dreadful
history
Questions
about
marriage
and
children
were
1911
and
1951
Censuses
.
The
former
had
asked
the
age
of
50
.
The
1961
Census
questions
related
to
all
women
who
were
or
had
been
married
","
and
so
repeated
the
enquiry
made
fifteen
years
earlier
by
the
1946
Family
Census
conducted
on
behalf
of
the
Royal
Commission
on
Population
.
The
questions
about
children
were
the
same
as
in
1951
","
except
that
they
extended
to
all
women
who
were
or
had
been
married
.
It
was
not
regarded
as
practicable
within
the
limits
of
the
census
to
include
particulars
about
the
date
of
birth
of
each
child
","
as
had
been
done
in
the
specialised
enquiry
for
the
Royal
Commission
.
The
innovation
at
the
1961
Census
","
though
the
Family
Census
had
previously
included
the
question
","
was
the
date
of
termination
of
the
first
or
only
marriage
.
This
enables
statistical
use
to
be
made
of
their
experience
as
regards
duration
of
marriage
and
number
of
children
in
the
case
of
women
whose
first
or
only
marriage
was
terminated
by
widowhood
or
divorce
after
the
end
in
the
size
and
pattern
of
families
for
successive
generations
over
as
long
a
period
as
possible
","
as
the
proportion
of
widows
predominates
in
the
higher
age
groups
.
In
Wales
and
Monmouthshire
the
question
on
the
ability
to
speak
Welsh
was
included
as
previously
.
The
question
was
first
asked
in
1891
","
and
was
given
its
present
form
in
1931

Each
census

the
number

each

.
A
new
question
asked
about

","
whether
the
accommodation
occupied
by
each
household
was
held
by
them
as
owner-occupiers

The
analysis
of
private
households
by
size
and
various
characteristics
of
their
members
has
become
increasingly
important
.
Previously

the
need
for
a
more
accurate
distribution
of
households
by
size
as
usually
constituted
had
become
more
important
by
1961

and
accordingly
a
new
question
was
introduced

The
second
part
of
our
Interim
Report
was
devoted
to
anaesthetists
who
become
addicted
to
the
gases
and
vapours
which
they
use
in
the
course
of
their
professional
duties
.
We
ascertained
that
the
incidence
of
this
irregular-
ity
was
very
small
indeed
.
However
","
over
a
period
of
eleven
years
","
patients'
lives
had
been
endangered
in
two
known
instances

We
were
assured
by
our
expert
witnesses

this
subject

apparatus

the
preliminary
sniffing
of

gases
immediately
before

them
to
a
patient
was
a
recognised
and
necessary
precaution

accepted
this

In
view
of
the
heavy
and
direct
responsibility
carried
by
every
anaesthetist
we
were
convinced
that
anyone

to
the
inhalation

never

The

was
untidy

two
rows
of
good-sized
windows

It
was
a
long
time
before
I
got
used

The

a

river

now
had
their

haggled

I
was
more
than

The

He
stared
at
her
of
half
words
.
He
slapped
himself
in
the
face
and
cuffed
the
sides
of
his
head
.
Then
by
degrees
the
rotating
objects
slowed
","
and
coming
into
focus
took
the
form
of
the
furnishings
in
Dan
Brown's
living
room
.
He
stood
up
un-
steadily
and
looked
about
the
room
","
trying
to
gather
his
wits
.
Outside
the
dusk
was
settling
over
Dow's
Lake
and
silhouette
","
already
a
solid
black
.
switched
it
on
.
Heather
McNabb
still
lay
on
the
couch
","
her
body
uncomfortably
twisted
and
afflicted
with
occasional
spasmodic
jerks
.
He
went
to
the
kitchen
for
water
and
found
Dan
.
Dan
was
lying
on
a
long
bench
in
the
breakfast
nook
","
his
head
bent
upright
against
the
wall
.
His
usually
animated
face
was
expressionless
and
looked
flat
","
as
though
his
nose
had
been
pushed
back
and
his
eyes
and
cheeks
brought
forward
.
He
mouthed
a
low
mutter
","
punctuated
at
intervals
with
a
few
syllables
of
a
crazy
and
incoherent
jargon
.
As
Steve
looked
at
him
his
mouth
suddenly
snapped
shut
","
with
jaws
askew
.
There
was
utter
imbecility
in
his
blank
face
.
Presently
the
muttering
started
again
","
and
went
on
and
on
.
Stunned
and
shaken
","
Steve
drew
a
glass
of
water
and
went
back
to
Heather
.
Half
an
hour
later
Heather
and
Steve
were
still
trying
to
shake-off
the
last
traces
of
hypnotic
after-effects
.
For
several
minutes
they
had
been
facing
each
other
across
a
low
table
","
like
two
old
convalescents
thoroughly
bored
with
each
other
through
forced
association
.
Then
something
like
a
zest
for
living
began
to
come
back
to
Steve
and
he
squeezed
her
hand
.
Her
face
took
on
enough
animation
to
produce
a
wan
smile
.
Dan's
low
mut-
tering
was
just
audible
from
the
kitchen
.
And
Steve
could
see
that
as
Heather
recovered
her
senses
and
emotions
she
was
growing
cold
and
numb
with
shock
.
She
had
seen
Dan
","
or
rather
the
physical
relic
of
him
-
the
empty
shell
of
flesh
and
bone
","
devoid
of
intellect
and
And
these
had
been
his
great
qualities
","
so
attractive
to
her
.
The
Base
Station
had
gone
before
","
discharging
its
narrow
plane
of
4ementalating
energy
along
the
length
of
the
Earth's
imaginary
longitudes
","
moving
reversed
progression

It
had
brought
the
First
Stage
in
the
Thetan
pattern
of
conquest
","
the
empty-minded
receptiveness
that
prepared
the
way
for
the
Second
Stage
.
He
rose
from
his
breakfast-nook
bench
and
came
into
the
livingroom
","
where
Heather
and
Steve
stood
aghast
at
his
entrance
.
He
came

almost
falling
forward

an
ungainly
shuffle

thrust
out
","

dangling
loosely

Then
","
abruptly
","
he
drew
himself
up
and
walked
on

of
his
toes
.
He
stretched
his
arms
drawing-in
great
breaths

Having

Peggy
manfully
shouldered
her
another
home
.
In
the
ten
years
of
married
life
this
had
already
happened
half
a
dozen
times
.
Such
is
the
life
of
a
naval
officer's
wife
.
John's
father
had
been
a
naval
officer
of
the
old
school
;
some
of
his
rigid
ideas
had
been
passed
on
to
the
second
generation
.
One
of
these
was
that
an
officer
should
join
a
ship
","
on
taking
up
a
new
appointment
","
at
nine
a.m.
precisely
","
dressed
in
the
modern
equivalent
of
frock-coat
and
sword
.
It
would
have
been
acceptable
to
all
concerned
if
John
had
stepped
into
Fort
Blockhouse
clad
in
plain-clothes
on
the
previous
night
","
but
ways
instilled
by
martinet
parents
have
a
habit
of
famous
Portsmouth
hostelry
","
second
only
in
historic
interest
to
The
George
","
unhappily
destroyed
by
German
bombs
during
the
last
war
.
Having
deposited
his
baggage
and
unpacked
his
overnight-bag
he
went
in
search
of
a
drink
.
The
lower
bar
was
empty
","
save
for
the
lady
known
by
all
habitue
man
who
was
staring
moodily
into
a
gin
and
tonic
.
must
have
been
worth
a
great
deal
to
the
proprietors
of
the
hotel
.
She
greeted
John
","
however
","
with
less
than
her
usual
cordiality
and
flashed
a
warning
glance
at
him
.
Evidently
the
other
occupant
of
the
bar

THERE
were
six
submarines
","
lying
in
pairs
alongside
the
jetty
at
Fort
Blockhouse
.
Black
and
grimly
businesslike
they
both
looked
and
sounded
","
for
all
of
them
were
rumbling
as
they
charged
their
electric
batteries
.
A
light
wind
wafted
the
smoke
of
diesel
exhaust
in
through
the
open
windows
of
the
Captain's
house
.
It
pervaded
every
room
but
neither
Harry
nor
Madeleine
Turton
noticed
its
existence
as
they
sat
in
silence
over
a
substantial
breakfast
.
Although
usually
a
very
talkative
lady
Madeleine
respected
her
husband's
silences
","
for
she
knew
they
betokened
a
worry
of
some
sort
.
There
had
been
many
such
breakfasts
lately
since
the
affair
of
Parsifal
.
Harry
had
lost
a
good
deal
of
weight
.
His
normal
placid
and
steady-going
manner
remained
","
but
she
could
see
that
it
no
longer
came
naturally
.
It
is
the
common
lot
of
all
Squadron
Senior
Officers
to
experience
such
catastrophes
as
the
loss
of
a
submarine
","
though
in
peace
time
these
happenings
are
few
and
far
between
.
This
is
the
testing
time
for
all
.
The
affair
blows
up
into
a
national
disaster
and
then
when
it
is
all
over
life
must
continue
as
before
.
During
this
period
the
Captain
must
present
an
unruffled
appearance
and
carry
on
as
if
nothing
unusual
has
happened
.
Harry
Turton
had
written
letters
to
the
bereaved
","
had
visited
many
in
the
locality
","
had
been
interviewed
by
the
Press
","
had
driven
his
surviving
submarines
a
good
deal
harder
than
usual
and
in
fact
had
applied
all
the
usual
specifics
suitable
for
such
occasions
.
He
rode
down
to
where
I
was
waiting
.
I
was
thinking
what
a
skill
he
had
for
reading
my
mind
.

was

were
woken
up
twice
about
dawn
by
a
soft
eruption

turtle-doves

was
strange

rain

and
we
looked
out

weeping
trees

curling
white
breath
of

The
land
looked

cried

We
had
a
morning
at

.
He
talked
about
people
.
Marc

used
to
live
here
and
an
Englishman
named
Lawrence
.
He
was
here
","
near

","
three

four
years

During

period
he
wrote
a
book
","
The
Lover

Lady
Chatterly

No
","
he
hadn't

it
;
Madame
did
all
the
reading
.
Lawrence
died
in
this
very
place
.
He
used
to
come
to
Pierre's
Bar
again
and
him
","
he
was
one
of
the
crowd
.
The
sun
came
out
;
Mart
went
shopping
;
I
sat
in
the
square
reading
the
Patriote
.
There
was
a
front-page
rear-attack
on
de
proposal
to
drop
radio-active
material
into
the
Mediterranean
between
Corsica
and
St
Raphael
.
All
the
murders
were
well
documented
and
had
the
air
of
being
written
by
an
ingenious
","
but
mad
film
director
of
the
Thirties
.
Monsieur
H
","
for

","
had
been
clubbed
and
throttled
to
death
by
his
wife
","
children
and
father-in-law
","
after
muddling
up
some
sheep
while
the
worse
for
drink
.
The
family
group
then
sat
down
for
a
late
lunch
before
the
father-in-law
telephoned
the
police
.
Then
again

Monsieur
V
","
owing
to
family
troubles
","
had
written
to
the
local
paper
and
the
superintendent
of
police
","
informing
them
that
he
was
on
the
point
Monsieur
V's
house
was
immediately
surrounded
by
firemen
and
other
officials
","
but
there
was
no
Monsieur
V.
He
telephoned
a
few
minutes
later
from
a
nearby
village
","
apologising
for
the
trouble
","
but
explaining
that
the
walls
were
porous
and
the
gas
had
escaped
.
General
relief
was
expressed
","
but
Monsieur
V
(
this
was
actually
reported
in
the
next
issue
)
returned
home
and
shot
himself
","
leaving
a
note
which
again
left
his
household
goods
Some
grim
comic
relief
was
provided
by
an
elderly
farm
labourer
out
for
a
shoot
who
hid
himself
in
a
bush
and
imitated
a
blackbird
.
Unfortunately
a
sporting
taxi-driver
was
after
this
very
bird
and
shot
the
farm-
labourer
in
the
face
.
All
","
however
","
pellets
were
easily
removed
and
the
labourer
was
able
to
return
to
work
the
same
afternoon
.
You
can
free-wheel
down
a
quarter
of
the
way
.
In
the
middle
of
the
journey
is
a
valley
with
a
sea
of
vines
and
olives
and
beaches
of
earth
pricked
to
blood
by
the
hoe
.
Rising
from
the
flecked
sea
are
like
limpets
to
the
rock
.
There
is
a
curd
of
morning
smoke
and
a
muffled
bell
taps
the
sky
.
Here
we
stopped
","
as
in
fine
weather
we
always
stopped
.
Down
below
is
the
village
of
Cagnes
","
but
between
are
pockets
of
heat
and
cold
like
the
hands
of
friends
or
strangers
","
and
a
flurry
of
early
smells
","
the
dark
bosoms
of
beech
and
the
thin
pine
fingers
kissed
by
the
sun
.
Then
here
was

and
the
old

The

bitter-sweet
with
the
ghosts
of
dead
monarchs
and
brilliant
could
catch
the
taste
of
dead
dreams
on
my
tongue
like
spray
.
We
parked
the
Lambretta
opposite
the
Negresco
","
and
went
to
the
beach
to
have
a
swim
.
Amazing
bedlam
rocked
in
our
eyes
.
The
sea
boiled
with
waves
","
they
galloped
to
the
walls
and
spumed
over
the
Promenade
des
Anglais
.
A
huge
crowd
had
collected
.
There
were
firemen
and
policemen
and
ambulances
","
and
the
eyes
of
the
spectators
were
hard
with

all
had

the

would
ring

them

the
mad
grandmother

bloody
child

the
crossroads

It
was
growing
cold
.
We
left
the
crowd
and
drove
back
to
Vence
.
The
cool
evening
perfumes
stood
beckoning
at
the
corners
of
the
roads

When
we
got

we
felt
exhausted

sickness
(
a
sense

mingled
with
the
memory
of

drummed
up

The
next
morning
","
in
the
square
opposite

","
I
read
about
the
Nice

catastrophe
in
the
Patriote

been

the

had
been
a

to

Madame

had
been
made
in

neighbourhood

and
it
transpired
that
Madame
N's
husband
had
made
an
arrangement

the
dead
lady's
sister

shore

but
instead
of
returning
to
her
brother-in-law

with
whom
she
had
an
illicit
relationship

","
she
went
to
her
fiance*?2's
house
and
reported
her
to
the
police
","
and
then
jumped
off
a
cliff
near
Monte
Carlo
.
The
day
I
promised
to
take
Catherine
down
to
visit
my
young
friend
Philip
at
his
school
in
the
country
","
we
were
to
leave
at
eleven
","
but
she
arrived
at
nine
.
Her
blue
dress
was
new
","
and
so
were
her
fashionable
shoes
.
Her
hair
had
just
been
done
.
She
looked
more
than
ever
like
a
pink
and
gold
Renoir
girl
who
expects
everything
from
life
.
Catherine
lives
in
a
white
house
of
the
river
.
She
helped
me
clean
up
my
flat
with
a
devotion
which
said
that
she
felt
small
flats
were
altogether
more
romantic
than
large
houses
.
We
drank
tea
","
and
talked
mainly
about
Philip
","
who

from
food
to
music
.
Catherine
looked
at
the
books
lying
around
his
room
","
and
asked
if
she
might
borrow
the
stories
of
Isaac
Babel
to
read
on
the
train

newspapers
and
watched
her
pretty
frowning
face
as
she
turned
the
pages
of
Babel
","
for
she
was
determined
to
let
nothing
get
between
her
and
At
the

the
two

and
I
followed
","
seeing
how
the
sun
gilded
their
bright
friendly
heads
turned
towards
each
other
as
they
talked
.
In
Catherine's
left
hand
she
carried
the
stories
of
Isaac
Babel
.
After
lunch
we
went
to
the
pictures
.
Philip
allowed

it
to
be
seen
that
he
thought
going
to
the
pictures
just
for
the
fun
of
it
was
For
his
sake
we
chose
the
more
serious
of
the
two
films
that
were
showing
in
the
little
town
.
It
was
about
a
good
priest
who
helped
cri-
minals
in
New
York
.
His
goodness
","
how-
ever
","
was
not
enough
to
prevent
one
of
them
from
being
sent
to
the
gas
chamber
;
and
Philip
and
I
waited
with
Catherine
in
the
dark
until
she
had
stopped
crying
and
could
face
the
light
of
a
golden
evening
.
At
the
entrance
of
the
cinema
the
doorman
was
lying
in
wait
for
anyone
by
her
suffering
arm
","
he
said
bitterly
:
'
Yes
","
why
are
you
crying
","
he
had
to
be
punished
for
his
crime
","
didn't
he
?
'
Cathe-
rine
stared
at
him
","
incredulous
.
Philip
rescued
her
by
saying
with
disdain
:
'
Some
people
don't
know
right
from
wrong
even
when
its
demonstrated
to
them
.
'
The
doorman
turned
his
attention
to
the
next
red-eyed
emerger
from
the
dark
;
and
we
went
on
together
to
the
station
","
the
children
silent
because
of
the
cruelty
of
the
world
.
Finally
Catherine
said
","
her
eyes
wet
again
:
'
I
think
its
all
absolutely
beastly
","
and
I
can't
bear
to
think
about
it
.
'
And
Philip
said
:
'
But
we
've
got
to
think
about
it
","
don't
you
see
","
because
if
we
don't
it
'll
just
go
on
and
on
","
don't
you
see
?
'
In
the
train
going
back
to
London
I
sat
beside

Catherine
.
She
had
the
stories
open
in
front
of
her
","
but
she
said
:
'
Philip
's
awfully
lucky
.
I
wish
I
went
to
that
school
.
Did
you
notice
that
girl
who
said
hullo
to
him
in
the
garden
?
